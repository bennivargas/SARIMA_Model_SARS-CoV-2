# SARIMA_Model_SARS-CoV-2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging, rapidly evolving virus that has devastated the world including the United States of America from 2020 to now [1]. 
Because it is rapidly evolving, prediction models are necessary in order to help government agencies including the 
county, state, and federal level to help either curb the spread of the virus or loosen restrictions if cases are low. 
With the former, deaths by COVID-19 can be mitigated as low as possible. 
With the latter, businesses can open up more and gatherings would be more socially acceptable and lawful, leading to a boost in the economy as well as boosting mental health. 
The current state-of-the-art is to use statistical modeling to predict the outcome of cases, 
of which there has been for predicting other related viruses and pandemics such as influenza [2]. 
As to why current solutions are not satisfying, oftentimes it takes a while for this type of information to be dispensed. 
Findings must be peer-reviewed before publishing and presenting to the public, which can take up to months before it is disseminated to the public. 
The analysis I propose will help predict summer 2021 COVID-19 cases, 
which will use current datasets up until the present time which will have the most up-to-date information to predict cases for this coming season (summer 2021). 
It has been debated how governing agencies should regulate COVID-19, 
including instating lockdowns, closing restaurants, regulating capacity limits, cancelling events, and vice versa. 
These events have a profound impact on American lives; thus, 
decisions of this magnitude requires an objective data-driven answer based on facts and data, and not based on subjective opinion. 
Furthermore, the availability of a dataset of daily cases in the USA allows such a data-driven answer to be applied. 

Since it is observed there are dates and an increasing trend as well as seasonality, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA)
time series analysis is the most befitting.
